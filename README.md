- Two level Bounded Volume Hierarchies
- Implicit surfaces through Ray Marching
- Parametric Surfaces (Paraboloids, etc)*
- Surfaces of revolution*
- Beveled curves and knots*
- Basic L-Systems

> \* Converted to meshes

Shading:
- Ambient Occlusion
- Path tracing with next event estimation

Materials (Path tracing):
- Specular reflection
- Specular transmission
