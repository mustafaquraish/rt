# Raytracer (++)

Mustafa Quraish (2021)

---
A ray-tracer written in C++. Heavily WIP. Currently does not do any shading,
will just display normals. Only geometry intersections implemented

---

Implemented:
- Arbitrary object transformations
- Implicit surfaces through Ray Marching
- Bounded Volume Hierarchies (Intersections very slow...)
- Triangle meshes (wavefront OBJ)

---

Backlog:
- Pretty much everything else in a ray-tracer.
