# Raytracer (++)

Mustafa Quraish (2021)

---
A ray-tracer written in C++. Heavily WIP. Currently does not do any shading,
will just display normals. Only geometry intersections implemented

---

Implemented:
- Arbitrary object transformations
- Triangle meshes 
- Wavefront OBJ file parsing
- Two level Bounded Volume Hierarchies
- Implicit surfaces through Ray Marching
- Parametric Surfaces (Paraboloids, etc)*
- Surfaces of revolution*
- Beveled curves and knots*
- Ambient Occulusion Shader


* Converted to meshes

---

Backlog:
- Pretty much everything else in a ray-tracer.
