# Raytracer (++)

Mustafa Quraish (2021)

---
A ray-tracer written in C++. Heavily WIP. Currently does not do any shading,
will just display normals. Only geometry intersections implemented

---

Implemented:
- Arbitrary object transformations
- Triangle meshes (wavefront OBJ)
- Two level Bounded Volume Hierarchies with mesh instancing
- Implicit surfaces through Ray Marching
- Surfaces of revolution (convert to mesh)
- Beveled parametric curves and knots (convert to mesh)

---

Backlog:
- Pretty much everything else in a ray-tracer.
